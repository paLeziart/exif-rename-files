EXIF rename
=============

Introduction
------------

The exif_rename_files.py is a python script used to rename, or copy, image files using the date in the EXIF information 
of the files. The input files must be in jpeg format, having an extension of the form ".jpg" or ".JPG". 

The file name has the form of "yyyy-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS.jpg".  If there is more than one file with the same date up to the second,
an extension of the form "_N" is added, giving "yyyy-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS[_N].jpg". "N" has a flexible number of digits. Hence, if there is 10 files with the same second, the first will be labeled with "01", preserving the alphabetical order of the images.

This script is ideal if you have many image files coming from more than one device, for example when two person goes 
into vacation and take pictures of their trip. It is also perfect to give a meaningful file name to file like "DSC0000.JPG".

It works under GNU/Linux, Windows and Apple OS.

Usage
-----

Copy the image directly in the folder where it is located:  
```bash
 python exif_rename_files.py /home/miguel/photo/DSC0000.JPG
```
<br />
Copy all the images directly in the folder where they are located:  
```bash
 python exif_rename_files.py /home/miguel/photo/
```
<br />
Copy the images coming from two directories, in a target directory:  
```bash
 python exif_rename_files.py --output-directory /home/miguel/photo/output/2013/  /home/miguel/photo/2013/ /home/pauline/photo/2013/
```
<br />
Copy the all the images in the input directory, including those in subfolders, in the target directory, but do not overwrite is there is already an image with the target file name:   
```bash
python exif_rename_files.py --no-clobber --recursive --output-directory /home/miguel/output  /home/miguel/photo
```
<br />
Use find to fetch all the file name starting with "DSC" or "dsc" and rename them:
```bash
find /home/miguel/photo/ -iname "DSC*" -exec exif_rename_files.py --move {} +
```


Installation
-----

### GNU/Linux

Copy the file in '/usr/local/bin' directory and change its permission so it can be executed
```bash
wget http://ptaff.ca/exif/exif_rename_files.py
sudo mv exif_rename_files.py /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/exif_rename_files.py
```

### Windows

### Mac OS X
First, you have to install the package `exifread` which is available via `pip`.
To install `pip`, install the [`python` `HomeBrew`](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/) package with the command
```bash
brew install python
```
Then, install [`exifread`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ExifRead) with
```bash
pip install exifread
```

Once those steps are done, you can follow the same steps as on GNU/Linux:
```bash
wget http://ptaff.ca/exif/exif_rename_files.py
sudo mv exif_rename_files.py /usr/local/bin
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/exif_rename_files.py
```
