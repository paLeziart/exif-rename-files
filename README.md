EXIF rename
=============

Introduction
------------

The exif_rename_files.py is a python script used to rename, or copy, image files using the date in the EXIF information 
of the files. The input files must be in jpeg format, having an extension of the form ".jpg" or ".JPG". 

The file name has the form of "yyyy-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS.jpg".  If there is more than one file with the same date up to the second,
an extension of the form "_N" is added, giving "yyyy-mm-dd_HH-MM-SS_N.jpg". "N" has a fix number of digits. Hence, if there is 
10 files with the same second, the first will be labeled with "01", preserving the alphabetical order of the images.

This script is ideal if you have many image files coming from more than one device, for example when two person goes 
into vacation and take pictures of their trip. It is also perfect to give a meaningful file name to file like "DSC0000.JPG".

It works under GNU/Linux, Windows and Apple OS.
